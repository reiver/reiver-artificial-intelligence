			A common way for normal people (who are <em>not</em> specialists in <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong>) to think about <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> is
			—
			to imagine an <em>artificial-brain</em> along with <em>humanoid robots</em>
			—
			robots that with 2 legs, 2 arms, a head, and the general form of a human, that walk and talk similar to a human.
			I.e., a common way for normal people (who are <em>not</em> specialists in <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong>) to think about <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> is to imagine an <strong>android</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although this lay-person conception of <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> (as an <strong>android</strong>) is definitely a type of <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong>
			—
			<strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> is broader than, even simpler than, this.
			I.e., <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> is more than just <strong>androids</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			But more on that later — let's explore the lay-person conception of <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> a bit more.
