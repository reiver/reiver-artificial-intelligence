			What is <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> (<abbr title="artificial-intelligence">AI</abbr>)‽

		<h2>Lay-Person <abbr title="artificial-intelligence">AI</abbr></h2>
		<p>
			A common way for normal people (who are <em>not</em> specialists in <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong>) to think about <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> is
			—
			to imagine an <em>artificial-brain</em> along with <em>humanoid robots</em>
			—
			robots that with 2 legs, 2 arms, a head, and the general form of a human, that walk and talk similar to a human.
			I.e., an <strong>android</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although <strong>androids</strong> are definitely a type of <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong>
			—
			<strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> is broader than, and even includes things that are much much much simpler than, this.
			I.e., <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> is a lot more than just <strong>androids</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example
			—
			<strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> includes (simple) <strong>linear-regression</strong>, <strong>epsilon-greedy</strong>, and other things with names that sound just as weird as these if you are <em>not</em> (yet) familiar with <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> jargon.
		</p>
		<p>
			But more on that later
			—
			let's first explore the lay-person conception of <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> a bit more.
			Let's look at <abbr title="science-fiction">sci-fi</abbr>
			—
			and in particular, <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong>, <strong>androids</strong>, and <strong>robots</strong> in <abbr title="science-fiction">sci-fi</abbr>.
