			<strong>Vectors</strong> get used a lot in <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Vectors</strong> are used to represent images.
			<strong>Vectors</strong> are to represent artificial neurons.
			Inputs to most models / algorithms are often turned into some type of <strong>vectors</strong>.
			Etc.
			<strong>Vectors</strong> are all over the place in <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			But, what is a vectorâ€½
		</p>
		<p>
			Oddly, the answer seems to depend on who you ask.
